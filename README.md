# Hey, I'm Shams E Shifat! 👋  

### 🖥️ About Me  
I'm a **Python enthusiast** currently doing work-study at **Jackson State University** in the **Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering**. I mostly work on **data analysis** and **ML/AI development** in civil engineering, but I love exploring all things tech.  

🔹 **What I Work With & Explore:**  
- 🐍 Python | SQL/PostgreSQL | Django  
- 💻 Linux (Arch + Hyprland) | Vim/Nvim ([My Dotfiles](https://github.com/s-shifat/dotfiles))  
- 🤖 Machine Learning & Deep Learning  
- 🏞️ Computer Vision  
- 🌍 Data Science & Geospatial Analysis  
- 🚀 Web Development  
- ⚡ Office Automation (Microsoft VBA & Google Apps Script)  
- 🌐 Browser Automation  

I’m always messing around with something—whether it’s automating workflows, building machine learning models, or tweaking my **Linux setup** just right. If it's **tech**, I’m probably interested!
